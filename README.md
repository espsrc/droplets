This initiative compiles a series of tutorials describing tools and good practices to make your research analysis more organized, automatic and reproducible with an astrophysical science case as a guiding thread.

The aim of platform is that we all share those tools that we can use in our daily work to make their research more flexible, efficient, collaborative and open. Discussions can happen in the [droplets](https://github.com/spsrc/droplets) Github page or in person in the regular sessions organized at the [Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia](https://www.iaa.csic.es/) (IAA-CSIC), a [Severo Ochoa Center](http://so.iaa.csic.es/).

We are collaboratively constructing documentation with details and examples on how to use these tools: [Documentation](https://droplets-spsrc.readthedocs.io/). 


## Purpose

- Make our research more flexible, efficient, collaborative and open
- Build a community to share know-how
- Discover and share tools and practices
- Promote Open and Reproducible Science



# Sessions at IAA-CSIC

We will organize demonstration sessions to showcase how these tools can be incorporated into astronomical research. In each session we will show a real-life example on how to use one tool, without entering in the technical details of how it works. We follow the principle of "show, don't tell" to present a tasting of tools that you may want to consider using. The sessions are complemented with the documentation we are building with details on how to install and use these tools ([Documentation](https://droplets-spsrc.readthedocs.io/)). 

Regular meetings will happen every two Mondays at 10:30 am in the room adjacent to the kitchen. We will be happy to stay afterwards for extended discussions and networking. We will get the ball rolling with Jupyter notebooks and will continue with other tools like git, conda, containers, pipelines and Zenodo. However, everybody is welcome to suggest or present a tool that they consider interesting as well. There are no technical requirements for the sessions, you just will need your coffee, not your laptop.

## Logistics
- Open for everyone to participate!
- Regular meetings twice a month
- You bring your coffee, we bring cookies
- Demonstration sessions to showcase tools
- Open for questions, discussions and networking

## What to expect
- Show, don't tell
- Details will be provided in the [Documentation](https://droplets-spsrc.readthedocs.io/)
- Informal presentations
- Training plan will evolve depending on feedback
