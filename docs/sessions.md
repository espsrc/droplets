# Session 01: Jupyter notebook, the XXI century lab book
- Date:  2020-03-02
- Presenter: Javier Moldón 

We demostrate how to create and access a Jupyter notebook to perform an exploratory analysis of a moving cluster using data from the *[Gaia](https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia)* satellite. The session notes are [here](https://github.com/spsrc/droplets/blob/master/sessions/droplets-01-jupyter-notebooks/droplets-01-jupyter-notebooks.md). Information on how to access the notebook in different ways is found in the [Jupyter notebooks](./jupyter.md) section.


# Session 02 - Keep your software organized with Conda

- Date:  2021-04-12
- Presenter: Sebastián Luna

Here we want to solve these two problems: first, we are trying to execute a notebook but we find that we don't have the relevant dependencies installed, so we use `conda` to manage them. Then, we show how to prepare a evnironment file so all the dependencies we need for our project are explicitly detailed, so we or our collaborators can run the notebook. The session notes can be found in [Session 02](https://github.com/spsrc/droplets/blob/master/sessions/droplets-02-conda/droplets-02-conda.md)
