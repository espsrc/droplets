# Session 01: Jupyter notebook, the XXI century lab book
- Date:  2020-03-02
- Presenter: Javier Moldón (IAA-CSIC)

We demostrate how to create and access a Jupyter notebook to perform an exploratory analysis of a moving cluster using data from the *[Gaia](https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia)* satellite. The session notes are [here](https://github.com/spsrc/droplets/blob/master/sessions/droplets-01-jupyter-notebooks/droplets-01-jupyter-notebooks.md). Information on how to access the notebook in different ways is found in the [Jupyter notebooks](./jupyter.md) section.


# Session 02 - Keep your software organized with Conda

- Date:  2021-04-12
- Presenter: Sebastián Luna (IAA-CSIC)

Here we want to solve these two problems: first, we are trying to execute a notebook but we find that we don't have the relevant dependencies installed, so we use `conda` to manage them. Then, we show how to prepare a evnironment file so all the dependencies we need for our project are explicitly detailed, so we or our collaborators can run the notebook. The session notes can be found in [Session 02](https://github.com/spsrc/droplets/blob/master/sessions/droplets-02-conda/droplets-02-conda.md)

# Session 03 - Collaborative science using Github

- Date: 2021-04-26
- Presenter: Manuel Parra (IAA-CSIC)

In this session we will have a gentle introduction to Github. The problem we want to solve is: what would be an efficient way of keeping our files under version control, being accessible online, allowing me and my collaborators to work in parallel and to contribute with files, code and discussions to a project while keeping everything organized and backed up? The notes of the session can be found in [Session 03](https://github.com/spsrc/droplets/blob/master/sessions/droplets-03-github/droplets-03-github.md). We also have a tutorial on how to start with Github and additional resources in the droplets webpage for [Collaborative science online, Github](https://droplets-spsrc.readthedocs.io/github/).

# Session 04 - Version control with git (episode I)

- Date: 2021-05-10
- Presenter: Manuel Parra (IAA-CSIC)

In this session we will introduce git. We will show how to work on a local repository, how to travel in (git)time and how to work with branches. The session notes are available in [Session 04](https://github.com/spsrc/droplets/blob/master/sessions/droplets-04-git/droplets-04-git.md). We also have a tutorial and additional resources in the [droplets webpage](https://droplets-spsrc.readthedocs.io/git/).
