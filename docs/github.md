# Taking your research online

You have received an e-mail from a good colleague.


!!! note "email"
    Hi again!

    Thanks a lot for sending me the notebook you prepared, but actually I cannot open it. How can I do that? Also, I will be travelling during the following days, if you could send me something I can explore from my mobile phone, that would be great!

    Cheers,

    Galileo    


We need to compile all our results and send them in a format that helps
understanding the process and the results of our analysis. One common approach
is to describe all the details in the body of the e-mail and send different
figures as attachments. This is a poor approach that complicate visualization,
makes it difficult to connect description and figures, and that probably will
miss details on how the results were obtained. Alternatively we can generate a
document with the content that we can then convert to pdf so it is easy to send
and be opened by anyone. However, using a Jupyter notebook has several
advantatges:

- It is easy to export as pdf or html, and can be visualized in nearly any platform.
- It naturally contains the results and the logic followed to obtain them, as already seen in the previous [chapter](docs/jupyter)
- It is immediate to generate them if an update is needed.
- It explicitly show the full process used at each step.

<h3>Objectives and scope</h3>

In this section we will show how to use Github to share results with the community or your colleagues. You will be able to share code, text documents, figures or notebooks, which can be rendered automatically.

### Why this is useful

Developing your project or analysis collaboratively on GitHub or GitLab
provides a prompter to document your work in detail and it provides a great
opportunity to get additional contributors to your idea. Contributions can be
everything from new ideas, to bug reports and actual code contributions.


### README and project communication

README files are the welcome mat for your project. They are the first thing new visitors to your project will see and thus are part of a set of really important documents to make potential contributors feel welcome and invite them to get involved. Your README file should cover:

 - What you are doing, for who, and why.
 - What makes your project special and exciting.
 - How to get started.
 - Where to find key resources.
