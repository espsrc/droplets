    Hi!
    
    The other day my friend Ptolemy told me about a "nebulous mass in the breast of Cancer". I observed it with my new telescope and I could resolve about 40 individual stars! This is amazing, and it could be a good topic for a paper. If you have time, please see if you can find anything interesting in this region.

You think it would be a good idea to explore the stellar population on this area. Because you are not sure what to expect and you want to try different approaches, you decide to start a Jupyter notebook and explore a star catalog around those coordinates...
