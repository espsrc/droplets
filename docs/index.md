# Open Science Droplets - Reproducible and Collaborative Research Resources for Astronomy

This initiative compiles a series of tutorials describing tools and good
practices to make your research analysis more organized, automatic and reproducible with
an astrophysical science case as a guiding thread.

We understand that people will learn a tool only when they need it or they see
the value on using it. Therefore, the tutorials follow the narrative of
presenting tools after a scientific necessity appears, such as the one to
share your work with colleagues, to train a new member in your team, or when you need to manage the dependencies of
some software you need.

Following this philosophy, we will aim towards full reproducibility following a simple system, by progressively incorporating new approaches as they respond to new necessities we encounter. The topics to cover include:

- Jupyter notebook: the XXI century lab book
- Collaborative science using Github
- Keep your software organized with Conda
- Python interactive visualization
- Share your results with the World with Binder
- Reproducible workflows to rule them all: Snakemake
- Fill your containers with software: Docker and Singularity 
- Your work for posterity: Zenodo
