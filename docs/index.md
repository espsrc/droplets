# Open Science Droplets - Reproducible and Collaborative Research Resources for Astronomy

This initiative compiles a series of tutorials describing tools and good
practices to make your research analysis more organized, automatic and reproducible with
an astrophysical science case as a guiding thread.

We understand that people will learn a tool only when they need it or they see
the value on using it. Therefore, the tutorials follow the narrative of
presenting tools after a scientific necessity appears, such as the necessity to
share your work with colleagues or when you need to manage the dependencies of
some software you need.

Following this philosophy, instead of presenting a complex system to organize full reproducibily at once, we will be progressively incorporating new approaches as they respond to new necessities we encounter. The topics covered here are:

- Jupyter: the XXI century lab book
- Collaborative Jupyter notebooks through git
- Software management with conda
- Python visualization and ipython widgets
- Share your results with the world with Binder
- Reproducible workflows to rule them all: Snakemake
- Contairenization for the posterit
- Your work for the posterity. Zenodo
