# Motivation

- Now we want to share it with our collaborator

# Create a repository on GitHub
- log into github.com (others: gitlab, bitbucket, etc)
- create and initialize a repository

# Share: Add the notebook to the repository
- Click upload files
- Choose the notebook from your PC

# Update the notebook
- jupyter lab # open and edit notebook
- git add
- git commit -m " here is my change "
- git push # see updated notebook in web browser

# Collaborate: GitHub issues
