# Motivation

We understand that people will learn a tool only when they need it or they see the value on using it. Therefore, the tutorials follow the narrative of presenting tools after a scientific necessity appears, such as the necessity to share your work with colleagues or when you need to manage the dependencies of some software you need.

# Plan

To progressively incorporate new approaches:

- Jupyter: the XXI century lab book
- Collaborative Jupyter notebooks through git
- Software management with conda
- Python visualization and ipython widgets
- Share your results with the world with Binder
- Reproducible workflows to rule them all: Snakemake
- Contairenization for the posterit
- Your work for posterity. Zenodo
